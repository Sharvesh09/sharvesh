      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="intro">Hey! As a biomedical engineering student, I'm on a mission to bring two worlds together: the intricate world of biological systems and the boundless potential of technology. My journey is powered by a relentless curiosity and a passion for coding and AI/ML, which I see as the language of innovation. Each project in my portfolio is a step toward merging these disciplines, turning complex data into actionable insights and creating solutions that make a tangible difference. I'm always looking for a new challenge and an opportunity to learn.</p>
