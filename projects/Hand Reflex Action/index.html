        Reflex actions are quick, involuntary responses to stimuli that occur without conscious thought.
        One common example is the hand withdrawal reflex, which occurs when we touch something hot or sharp.
        This response is controlled by a reflex arc — a simple nerve pathway involving a sensory neuron, spinal cord,
        and motor neuron. In this project, we simulate the hand reflex mechanism using an Arduino-based setup,
        where a stimulus triggers an automatic response, demonstrating how the nervous system reacts instantly to
        protect the body from harm.

        In our project, this natural reflex mechanism is simulated using an Arduino, LM35 temperature sensor,
        and a servo motor:
        <br><br>
        • The LM35 sensor detects rising temperature, mimicking a harmful stimulus.<br>
        • The Arduino processes the sensor data, acting like the spinal cord in the human body.<br>
        • If the temperature exceeds a set limit, the servo motor is triggered.<br>
        • The servo then moves the hand model away, simulating the reflex action.<br><br>
        This project visually demonstrates how reflex arcs work — detecting danger and reacting instantly
        without waiting for conscious brain decisions, just like in real human reflexes.

      This project successfully demonstrates the concept of a hand reflex action using an Arduino, LM35 temperature sensor,
      and a servo motor. By simulating the reflex arc, it highlights how the human body responds rapidly to harmful stimuli
      without conscious effort. The model provides a clear understanding of how sensory input is processed and translated
      into immediate motor response through a simple yet effective electronic representation. This not only reinforces
      biological learning but also shows how technology can be used to mimic human physiological processes.
