    <h1>HAND REFLEX ACTION</h1>
    <p>
      Reflex actions are quick, automatic, and protective responses to stimuli that occur without conscious control.
      One of the most common examples is the hand withdrawal reflex — when we instantly pull our hand away
      after touching something hot or sharp. This process involves a specialized neural pathway known as a reflex arc.
      In this project, we recreate this life-saving mechanism using an Arduino-based setup to demonstrate how the body
      reacts within milliseconds to protect itself from potential harm.

      <p>
        The reflex arc consists of three main components — a sensory neuron, the spinal cord, and a motor neuron.
        When a stimulus is detected, sensory signals travel to the spinal cord, which processes the input and sends
        an immediate response signal to the motor neuron. This bypasses the brain to ensure a rapid reaction.
        In our simulation, this concept is replicated using electronic components that mimic these biological functions.

        The working of our model is simple yet powerful:
        <br><br>
        • The LM35 sensor detects rising temperature, acting as the sensory receptor.<br>
        • The Arduino processes this data — functioning as the spinal cord.<br>
        • When the temperature crosses a predefined threshold, the servo motor is triggered.<br>
        • The servo moves the mechanical hand model away, symbolizing the body’s protective response.<br><br>
        This precise simulation highlights the beauty of biological reflexes — a perfect blend of speed and safety
        without requiring conscious thought.

      This project successfully replicates the concept of a hand reflex action using an Arduino, LM35 temperature sensor,
      and a servo motor. It offers a tangible understanding of how sensory input and motor response are linked through
      neural coordination. Beyond biology, this setup bridges the gap between technology and physiology — showing
      how electronic systems can mimic natural human responses in an educational and visually engaging way.
