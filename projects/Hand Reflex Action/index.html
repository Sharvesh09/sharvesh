    <h1>HAND REFLEX ACTION</h1>
    <p>
      Reflex actions are rapid, automatic, and protective responses that occur without conscious control.
      One of the best examples is the hand withdrawal reflex — when we instantly pull our hand away after
      touching something hot or sharp. This quick reaction prevents tissue damage and ensures survival.
      In this project, we replicate that natural response using an Arduino-based system that reacts
      immediately to a harmful stimulus, just as the human nervous system does. The project bridges
      biology and electronics, showing how sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators can mimic neural behavior.

      <p>
        The human reflex arc involves three essential components — sensory neurons, the spinal cord, and motor neurons.
        When a stimulus is detected by receptors in the skin, sensory neurons send signals to the spinal cord.
        The spinal cord processes this input and instantly transmits a response through motor neurons to move the muscles.
        In our setup, we use an <b>LM35 temperature sensor</b> to detect heat, the <b>Arduino</b> as the processing unit,
        and a <b>servo motor</b> to simulate muscle movement — all working in harmony to replicate this biological mechanism.

        The LM35 continuously monitors temperature levels, and when the readings cross a safe threshold,
        the Arduino immediately triggers the servo motor. This movement represents the hand pulling away
        from a dangerous stimulus. The process is instantaneous and does not require external input,
        beautifully imitating the body's natural reflex mechanism that operates independently of the brain.

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="summary">
    <p>
      This project demonstrates how electronic components can represent complex biological functions.
      By building a reflex arc model with Arduino, LM35, and a servo motor, we provide a deeper understanding
      of how the nervous system prioritizes survival through immediate action. Beyond its educational value,
      this project showcases how biomedical engineering blends life sciences and technology to recreate
      the brilliance of human physiology.
