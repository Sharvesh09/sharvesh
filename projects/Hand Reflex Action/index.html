          Reflex actions are quick, involuntary responses to stimuli that occur without conscious thought.
          One common example is the hand withdrawal reflex, which occurs when we touch something hot or sharp.
          This response is controlled by a reflex arc, a simple nerve pathway involving a sensory neuron,
          spinal cord, and motor neuron. In this project, we simulate the hand reflex mechanism using
          an Arduino-based setup, where a stimulus triggers an automatic response, demonstrating how
          the nervous system reacts instantly to protect the body from harm.

          In our project, this natural reflex mechanism is simulated using an Arduino, LM35 temperature sensor,
          and a servo motor:<br><br>
          • The LM35 sensor detects rising temperature, mimicking a harmful stimulus.<br>
          • The Arduino processes the sensor data, acting like the spinal cord in the human body.<br>
          • If the temperature exceeds a set limit, the servo motor is triggered.<br>
          • The servo then moves the hand model away, simulating the reflex action.<br><br>
          This project visually demonstrates how reflex arcs work: detecting danger and reacting instantly
          without waiting for conscious brain decisions — just like in real human reflexes.

      <p>
        This project successfully demonstrates the concept of a hand reflex action using an Arduino,
        LM35 temperature sensor, and a servo motor. By simulating the reflex arc, it highlights how the
        human body responds rapidly to harmful stimuli without conscious effort. The model provides a
        clear understanding of how sensory input is processed and translated into immediate motor response
        through a simple yet effective electronic representation. This not only reinforces biological learning
        but also shows how technology can be used to mimic human physiological processes.
